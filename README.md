## Getting Started

Instructions on how to get started with your project, including installation, prerequisites, and basic usage.

### Prerequisites

- Knowledge of basic html5 templates, css and javascript.
- Knowledge about Iframes and usages.
- Knowledge of web components and usages.

### Installation

#### Project setup

```

## Usage

We are comparing performance between iframe and webcomponents. Here is the data we have collected:

| Type                       | Load Time (in ms) |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Iframe with Web Components | 0.79              |
| Iframe with HTML           | 0.70              |
| Only Web Components        | 0.50              |
| Single HTML                | 0.80              |
